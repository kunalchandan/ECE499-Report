\section{Indium Electroplating}

\subsection{Introduction}
There are a variety of methods for indium electroplating, while I did not select the electroplating process there are a variety of methods available that are commonly used in industry. The largest differences tend to be in what comprises of the solution and the operating temperatures.

\subsection{Process}
The indium electroplating process is based on a now industry standard process that is known to yield good results while requiring a minimum of process optimization.

Adapting the indium electroplating process to the E3-3139 and the resources available there, the process was as follows:

The process used here allows us to electroplate indium onto the substrate that is Chrome-Gold on Sapphire. Both chromium and gold are excellent materials for indium to easily electroplate onto.

\subsection{Existing Setup Description}

In summary the process has us prepare the sample with acids before placing into the plating solution. Then the sample holder and sample are submerged in the plating solution and the current source is applied. However due to cost constraints a voltage source was obtained to perform in place of a current source.

A current source would have been preferred over a voltage source due to several reasons. Since electroplating is a process where metal ions are deposited on a substrate through the use of an electric current. The amount of metal deposited is directly proportional to the amount of electric charge that flows through the system, which means that controlling the current is crucial for controlling the thickness and quality of the plated layer.

With a current source, the current can be precisely controlled and maintained at a constant level, which results in consistent and uniform plating as a function of time. On the other hand, a voltage source may not provide a consistent current, as the resistance of the plating solution can vary due to factors such as temperature or impurities, leading to poor plating results.

Another advantage of using a current source is that it allows for better control over the plating process and reduces the risk of overplating or underplating. With a voltage source, the voltage applied to the system can cause the plating rate to fluctuate, which can result in uneven thickness or even damage to the substrate. In contrast, a current source ensures a constant and controlled deposition rate, which minimizes the risk of defects or damage to the substrate.

Using a voltage source with an ammeter can be equivalent to a current source in certain situations. This is because the voltage applied to a circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it. By measuring the current in the circuit using an ammeter, the current can be controlled by adjusting the voltage. In this way, the voltage source with an ammeter can effectively act as a current source.

The sample holder consists of two plastic blocks that are held together by two steel bars. Thumbscrews are used to lock the relative position of the plastic pieces in place while the assembly 'floats'  on the lip of the beaker the sample is submerged into. One of the two plastic peices has a stopper that helps constrain the position of the assembly on the beaker while the other plastic piece holds the glass rod and aligator clip.

The glass rod is attached to the plastic piece and has the aligator clip on it. The clip and corresponding cathode holder are wrapped in a PTFE sleeve that helps minimize stray electric fields and electroplating onto the cathode wire.



\subsection{Phsyiscal Problems with the setup}


The existing setup came with an analog voltage supply that was only able to provide analog control of the voltage based on two knobs (a fine and coarse). This control was only fine enough to $\pm10mA$ where the derivative of the current with respect to voltage in the relevant regime was $\frac{d mA}{d mV} = \frac{3 mA}{1 mV}$. This meant there was poor resolution on the current control.

I replaced the existing voltage supply with a Tektronics function generator as it provided the appropriate resolution and dynamic range appropriate for such a fine task.

\subsection{Experimental Issues - Deviation from Theory}

According to the Indium corporation docs, the recommended electroplating current density for plating is \dots
Converting to SI units from ASME units we see that this yields a plating current of \dots . However in this analysis we have only considered the active plating area of the sample and we have failed to consider the plating area of the exposed aligator clip that holds the sample.
