\section{Phase 1 - Uniform Bonding}

\subsection{Characterization of Indium Bonding Spread}

Once there was a repeatable electroplating process developed the second step was to understand how the indium would spread once diebonded

Insert stuff about the tresky diebonder here

Insert calculation of bonding volume
Diebonding process fits here as well

\subsection{Thermal Simulations}

Insert figures about the thermal simulations and refer to the code that is in the appendix

Discuss the lack of wetting to the LEDs. insert the sem images and the EDX images

\subsection{Conformation to Theory}
Conformed to theory when the bonding would spread according to the calculated volume

\subsection{Development of a Repeatable Process}
% Adding anchors
