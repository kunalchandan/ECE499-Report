\subsection{Improving cleanliness of process}

I acquired a 4-inch wafer to place the LED on while it was being picked up for diebonding. The wafer is also surface activated and placed in the plasma cleaner with the rest of the samples to ensure it is also relatively clean. The wafer when not being used is placed in the wafer carrier tray. Furthermore, the bonding head is regularly cleaned with IPA before being used.
