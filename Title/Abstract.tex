\chapter*{Abstract}
Micro LEDs (\uled s) are an exciting, new technology that hold the potential to improve upon the capabilities of the incumbent display technologies of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Researchers and industry leaders deem \uled s capable of significant advantages in display technologies particularly with key performance metrics in contrast, colour gamut, pixel response timings, display lifetime, and power consumption.
Currently, there are a variety of technical challenges in fabrication to making the dream of \uled \ displays a reality. During this research project I aim to assist in developing a process for packaging \uled  displays onto an addressable backplane.
To achieve this we use electroplated indium to create a mechanical and electrical connection between the \uled s and thin-film-transistor (TFT) backplane.
